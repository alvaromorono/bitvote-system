1 - Roles: Citizens, Candidates and Admins

-The Admin serves as equivalent to the spanish "Junta Electoral Central" which has indeed the same power as the admin.
In case of the admin being undemocratic, it could easily be sued and answer to law, in a modern democracy.

A branch is created to continue the project with no admin.

-Citizens are all users of the Ethereum Blockchain granted the access to special functions, which indeed control the bitvote system. The citizen role is acquired by bureaucratic means specified by the spanish administration. And it is effectively given to an account by the admin.

-Candidates are all users with the same level of access as citizens, except for the right to stand for elections. The candidate role is acquired by bureaucratic means specified by the spanish administration. And it is effectively given to an account by the admin.
