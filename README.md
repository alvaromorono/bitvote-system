1 - Roles: Citizens, Candidates and Admins

-The Admin serves as a 'guardian' of the system. It is the Role with the most access of the system. For the system to operate correctly a clear legislation must be drafted so that it cannot abuse its power or destroy the democracy of the system. Ultimately, the admin answers to the laws dictated by the citizens, so it is in our hands that the admin is kept under constant control. We could refer to it as a vague equivalent to the spanish "Junta Electoral Central". In case of the admin being undemocratic, it could easily be sued and answer to law, in a modern democracy. Note that the admin is not a single person, but an institution.

A branch is created to continue the project with no admin. For more info see branch 'no-central-admin'.

-Citizens are all users of the Ethereum Blockchain granted the access to special functions, which indeed control the bitvote system. The citizen role is acquired by bureaucratic means specified by the spanish administration. And it is effectively given to an account by the admin. The admin can take away the citizenship of someone if that were needed.

-Candidates are all users with the same level of access as citizens, except for the right to stand for elections and the duty of legislate if elected. A citizen can become a candidate by bureaucratic means specified by the spanish administration. Once the process is fulfilled the admin grants the ability to be voted to the candidate. The admin can remove a citizen from the position of candidate if that were needed.

A branch is created in which the CandidateRole still exists. For more info see branch 'candidate-role'.
